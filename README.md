# Unexpected Null Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments to the `foo` function.  The original code lacks robust null checks, leading to potential issues.  The solution provides a more comprehensive approach to handle null and undefined inputs.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function exhibits unexpected behavior when `null` values are passed as arguments.  The intended functionality is to perform an operation; however, the existing null check is insufficient.  This leads to a silent failure or unexpected outcomes, depending on subsequent operations within the function.

## Solution

The solution includes improved null handling.  It explicitly checks for both `null` and `undefined` values, providing more robust error handling and ensuring the function behaves as intended.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node bug.js` with various combinations of arguments, including `null` values.
3. Observe the unexpected results.

## How to use the solution

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node bugSolution.js` with various combinations of arguments, including `null` values.
3. Observe the improved handling of `null` inputs.
